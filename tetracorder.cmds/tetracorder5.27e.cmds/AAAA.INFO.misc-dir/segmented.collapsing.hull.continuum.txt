Segmented upper hull has no convexity, so continuum fails in situations
where the continuum is concave.

segmented collapsing hull allows concavity.

Specify a minimum segment length, e.g. the max width of a
spectral feature.  Then the hull can follow a concave continuum,
e.g. in a broad absorption to find a narrow feature superimposed
on the broad absorption.

example: narrow OH feature superimposed on a broad
pyrozene band.
