This directory contains commands and support files
for computing abundances.  There are 4 abundance models
which are described in AAA.readme.models and in

Clark, R. N., G. A. Swayze, K. E. Livo, P. Brodrick, E. Noe
Dobrea, S. Vijayarangan, R. O. Green, D. Wettergreen,
A. Candela, A. Hendrix, C. P. Garcia-Pando, N. Pearson,
M. D. Lane, A. Gonzalez-Romero, X. Querol, and the EMIT and
TREX teams, 2024, Imaging spectroscopy: Earth and planetary
remote sensing with the PSI Tetracorder and expert systems
from Rovers to EMIT and Beyond Planetary Science Journal 5:276,

The abundances here are a restricted set to a particular
application: the EMIT instrument on the Space Station
to map minerals in arid regions of the Earth for climate
change models to more accurately model the radiative forcing
of dust.  With this limited set of minerals, results may
not be as accurate in other geologic environments, including
other planets.

Main issues in accurate abundances are accuracy of published optical
constants, and accurate grain sizes of the samples used for reference  
spectra in the Tetracorder expert system.


Once a tetracorder run is complete. run the abundance models.
Example commands are in cmds.abundances-examples

Once the abundance models are complete (cmd.compute-model-abundances is complete),
some tools to assess output:

run from the mapping directory:

./cmds.abundances/cmd.image.moments.all  |& tee abundances-image.moments.out.txt  # or similar output name

cmd.get-model4-abundances-for-a-pixel xpixel ypixel  #  lists the abundances for a given pixel

If the images are very large in width and you want to make small
images to put into presentationsm run from the cmds.abundances directory:

./cmd.make.model1.small.images
./cmd.make.model4.small.images

These commands make images limited to 1280 pixels width


Similarly, from the mapping directory, run

./cmds.color.support/cmd.make.color.results.small.images

to make 1280 pixel images of the color results.  A set of
separate key files are also made.
