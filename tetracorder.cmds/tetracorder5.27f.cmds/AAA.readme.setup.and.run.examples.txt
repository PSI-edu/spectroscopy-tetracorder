 How to run tetracorder

Tetracorder has 3 basic modes of operation:
1) Image cube mapping.
2) Single spectrum analysis.
3) Single spectrum, real-time analysis (analyze incoming data from a spectrometer).

Run the command:
/t1/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder5.27c.cmds/cmd-setup-tetrun
with no options on the command line and it will tell you command line parameters and options needed.

Examples:

#########################################################################
1) Image cube mapping. Say we want to map in directory /data1/aviris/cuprite95 and the image cube to be mapped is in a
directory /data1/aviris/cuprite95/cube.

cd /data1/aviris/cuprite95
ls -l cube

-rw-rw-r-x 1 rclark users 267371212 Dec 28  2011 cuprite.95.cal.rtgc.v
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rclark users       212 Dec 28  2011 cuprite.95.cal.rtgc.v.hdr

Run the command:
/t1/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder5.27c.cmds/cmd-setup-tetrun testrun1 aviris_1995 cube ../cube/cuprite.95.cal.rtgc.v -10 50 c
0.8 1.1 bar

Mapping results will be in the directory testrun1. The above command will create the directory, install the necessary
components then give you two commands to execute: cd to the directory and the command to run the tetracorder and create all
output products once you are in the directory:

cd testrun1
time ./cmd.runtet cube <& cmd.runtet.out &

2) Single spectrum analysis. This mode is similar to the setup like in case 1 above. If no directory has been set up (no
image cube, instead of cube, specify singlespectrum. Example:

/t1/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder5.27c.cmds/cmd-setup-tetrun testrun1 aviris_1995 singlespectrum nofollow -10 50 c 0.8 1.1 bar

cd testrun1

Typically you would start specpr and assign any aditional specpr files youi may need.
Exit specpr

Next, start teracorder with the command:

tetracorder5.27single r1

then redirect input at the first command line prompt:

<cmds.start.t5.27c.single

Then analyze any spectrum in an assigned specpr file.

This mode can also be invoked from a directory where a cube mapping run has been completed, and is usualy done by a user
working to verify results of a mapping run by extracting spectra from the cubes and analyzing them individually. That allows
greater diagnostic output made by the tetracorder expert system.

3) Single spectrum, real-time analysis This mode is similar to #2, except the incoming real-time spectra are to a specific
specpr file. Example:

/t1/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder5.27c.cmds/cmd-setup-tetrun testdir ASDFS singlespectrum follow 0 80 c 0.9 1.1 bar autostart

There is a command that does this the above for ASD specrometer data, like being done for rover tests:

/t1/tetracorder.cmds/tetracorder5.2a.cmds/cmd.tetracorder.rover.ASD.setup.and.autostart testdir
