\#
\#              D vs M details:
\#                     The D is a diagnostic feature.  When there are multiple
\#                     diagnostic features defined, only one is needed to be enabled.
\#                     In the case of azurite, both are needed, but the band
\#                     between 0.45 and 1.3 microns is more important. 
\#
\#                     If a calibration results in one D feature being disabled,
\#                     the second (or third) D will still allow detection.
\#                     This is different than if all disgnostic features are
\#                     enabled, and if one is not present (feature strength
\#                     is zero or fiit too low) then the material will not
\#                     found.
\#
\#                     The M solves the problem of a disabled D feature, 
\#                     requiring all M-declared features to be enabked and present.
\#                     If one M feature is disabled, the material ID is disabled.
\#                     This was required for group 1 azurite, for example.

\# make the Fe2+, then any 2.3 feature dominates the results
