Be sure specpr (/src/local/specp/src.specpr has been compiled first.
Tetracorder uses many subroutines from the specpr package.

Tetracorder must be compiled twice, once for single spectrum mode, once for cubes
(assuming you want to do both).
NOTE: for only single spectrum mode operations, e.g. the Carnegie Mellon U./TREX rover tests
      only the installsingle step needs to be done.

vi multmap.h
   search for  imaxch  where you will find 4 blocks.

   uncomment block B, the line with "parameter" (make sure blocks A, B, and C are commented out)
   save

run:

make installsingle |& tee make.1.single.out.txt

Next:

vi multmap.h
   search for  imaxch  where you will find 4 blocks.

   comment out the B block
   uncomment the A block

run:

make install |& tee make.1.cube.out.txt
