splib06b

Making data product files Convolutions.

First you must make a higher channel interpolated library.  This
increases the trapezoidal integration in the convolution routines by
giving more bins per input spectrometer channel.
Nicolet and ASD Fieldspectrometer data are not interpolated.

           mak.splib06b.splin.cmds

(This takes a couple of seconds on modern computers.)

Next:

           cp startfiles/splib06b.start splib06b
           cp restartfiles/r1.splib06b  r1.splib06b

Next start specpr (or dspecpr) with the r1.splib06b restart file and execute the
specpr command file (optional: use -gxterm2 instead of -gxterm to get a larger
window):

           dspecpr r1.splib06b -gxterm -
           <splib06b.splin.cmds
