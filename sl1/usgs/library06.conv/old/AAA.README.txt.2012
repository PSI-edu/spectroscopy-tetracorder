This file describes how to create the splib06* convolved spectral libraries.

Convolved spectral library names can be at most 8-characters long,
because of a name size limit in specpr, which manages libraries,
so the following abbreviations are used.

Step 1)  Make any needed symbolic links (see STEP 1 below).

Step 2)  Make sure splib06b exists and contains the spectral library.
         Run:  spprint splib06b  and you should see hundreds of spectra
         listed.  If not, follow instructions in:

                  AAA.README.splib06b.txt

Step 3)  Choose a new convolved library 8-character name (see STEP 3 below)
   
Step 4)  make the waves.txt and resol.txt files with your
         wavelengths and resolution ascii listings.
         (see STEP 4 below)

Step 5)  run make.new.convol.library.start.file
         (see STEP 5 below)

Step 6)  Start specpr and verify that the wavelengths and resolution were
         read into specpr correctly.  If not, fix the ascii files in
         step 4 above or do it manually as described in
                 AAA.README.the.manual.specpr.way.txt
         See STEP 6 below.

Step 7)  Run the  mak.convol.library  command to make the new convolved library
         (see STEP 7 below)

===============================================================================
STEP 1 details:

Note: on speclab1, speclab3, cassini, etc, make a link:

     ln -s /s0/d1/speclib/ /speclib

     Customize for you own location by adding a symbolic link sp /speclib
     points to your libraries.

===============================================================================
STEP 2 details:

NOTE: splib06b must be made before any convolutions are made.

See:  AAA.README.splib06b.txt

===============================================================================
STEP 3 details:   Choose a new convolved library 8-character name

            a = s for spectral library
            nn= library version number
            cc= output convolved spectrometer model/type
            yy= year or other code
            d = output spectrometer version within year yy


         as = aster,
         av = aviris,  e.g. aviris 1995: av95a
         cr = crism
         hd = Hydice,
         hy = HyMap
         mi = MIVIS
         mm = Moon Mineralogy Mapper (2008)
         nm = nims,
         pb = probe
         pf = Mars pathfinder
         tm = LandsatTM (followed by 04, 05, 07 for with TM)
         vm = vims

         ng = na test


         nc = nicolet, followed by wavenumber resolution, e.g 4 cm^-1
              would be nc04, 0.5 cm^1 would be nc.5

         fs00 = ASD field spectrometer 2151
         fs71 = ASD field spectrometer 717ch
         fs35 = field spectrometer 358ch
         bk1x = usgs beckman, 1x = standard resolution
         gr = gregg's resolution study,

    Examples:
         s06av95a  # aviris 1995
         s06vm07a  # Cassini VIMS 2007 wavelengths
         s06mm09c  # Moon Mineralogy Mapper 2009 global wavelengths
         s06crj3a  # CRISM 2012 J_MTR3 merged V+IR version


===============================================================================
STEP 4 details:   make the waves.txt and resol.txt files with your
                  wavelengths and resolution ascii listings.


         waves.txt is a 1-column ascii list of the wavelengths in microns
         resol.txt is a 1-column ascii list of the resolution (FWJM) in microns

         No tabs are allowed
         No carriage returns immediately after the numbers (a space then a
                             carriage return is OK).

===============================================================================
STEP 5 details: run make.new.convol.library.start.file

        ./make.new.convol.library.start.file   library_name   \
                number_of_channels  title2  wave_title  resol_title

        library_name = the name you chose above (e.g. s06av95a)

        number_of_channels = number of channels in the spectrum

        title2 = the title for specpr record 2 (see examples below) 

        wave_title = title of the wavelengths specpr record

        resol = title of the resolution specpr record

        NOTE: titles MUST be in quotes

    Example:

       ./make.new.convol.library.start.file s06testb 438 \
              'Convolved crism testb 438 ch library' \
              'Wavelengths in microns 438 ch CRISMb' \
              'Resolution  in microns CRISMb'

===============================================================================
STEP 6 details:

         Start specpr and verify that the wavelengths and resolution were
         read into specpr correctly.  If not, fix the ascii files in
         step 4 above or do it manually as described in
                 AAA.README.the.manual.specpr.way.txt


Notes: Specpr record numbering:
Padding is added to records so that spectra with 2171 channels or
less all have the same record number in the convolved libraries.


A specpr start file has the entries like this example for ABVIRIS 1995,
which you must create by hand in specpr using the steps above:

It is very important that the:

           ".." file is in record 5,
            wavelengths in record 6,
            resolution  in record 12,

and the file be padded to record 29 so that the first convolved spectrum goes into
record 30.  This strategy ensures that spectra with channels 1 to 2171 will
have the same record numbers.  Spectra greater than 2171 channels is not yet
supported.

The spepcr restart file:

     v = the convolved instrument library (this is the output of the convolutions.
     y = splib06b

Disply the resolution on a specpr plot:
     from the main specpr menu:
       t
       v12V6
                 examine plot
       e
       EX

===============================================================================
STEP 7 details:


To convolve a library after the specpr restart and startup files are created,
run the command:


     mak.convol.library  library version channels name     resol_number


example:

     mak.convol.library  s06av95  a        224   AVIRIS95 12

creates spectral library s06av95a
This takes several minutes.
