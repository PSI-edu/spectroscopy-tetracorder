This file contains VIMS 2007, 352 channel wavelengths and resolution. 
This resolution was in effect at the time of the RC12 VIMS calibration,
3+ years into the primary mission, and still effective as of
January, 2008. (Note: some chanels around the 4.3 micron CO2 absorption
are off up to 1/2 channel.)  Other wavelengths are beleived accurate
to within 2 nm.
