SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION:
<p>
This is not a spectrum of a collected sample but it is an average of 174
spectra collected of the Stonewall Playa surface when it was dry on Aug.
28th, 2001.  The field spectra where collected in a polygonal area
denoted by the GPS coordinates corners given above.  Spectra were
collected while holding the spectrometer fiber optic about 1 meter above
the surface and walking while collecting.  This  method smears the
spectrum collection over an oval area a couple of meters long.  About 6
offset traverses were made in each of two orthogonal direction within
the sample polygon.  This polygon is located a couple of hundred meters
northeast of the big engraved "peace" sign.  All 174 spectra were
averaged, then corrected to absolute reflectance using a National
Institute of Standards spectralon correction.  Atmospheric absorptions
were minimal during spectral collection and were removed from the
averaged spectrum by physically moving the spectrum data points one at a
time into positions corresponding to the ground reflectance given by
laboratory spectra of a series of field samples.  Only data points near
1.2, 1.4, 1.9, and 2.05 microns were modified in this way to remove all
traces of atmospheric residues in the field spectra.  The sample
polygon is approximately a few hundred meters on a side.

SPECTROSCOPIC_DISCUSSION:
<p>
The spectrum is relatively bright with an over all reflectance of about
54%.  Spectral absorptions are weak with the strongest 1.908 microns due
to adsorbed or structural water in hydrated phases.  The 1st OH overtone
is located at 1.4110 microns.  There is a weak Fe-absorption at 0.9127
microns.  The 6% band at 2.2074 microns is mostly due to montmorillonite
with contributions from muscovite.  A very weak calcite band may be
indicated by a .3% absorption at 2.344 microns.
